A running total is the summation of a sequence of numbers which is updated each time a new number is added to the sequence, by adding the value of the new number to the previous running total.


A running total is the cumulative sum of a value and all previous values in the column.


Running Total Calculation in SQL

In SQL, the running total is calculated with the help of window functions.

SELECT 
    columns...,
    SUM(column to sum) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM table

Inside Over, don't use partition by because we don't need to partition the totals. The total partitioned is not the running total.

SELECT
      date,
      plan,
      SUM(plan) OVER(order by Date) AS plan_running_total,
      realization,
      SUM(realization) OVER(order by Date) AS realization_running_total
FROM sales;
